description: commit staged changes to git

You must ignore untracked files.

You need to run lint checking to make sure the lint check pass. If necessary, format the changed code before committing the changes.

Then you add all changed files as staged changes.

You should commit changes only, do NOT push to remote github.

The commit message should be short, succinct.

The commit author should be current github user, do not co-author with anthropic or claude code.
